## Supported Versions

There are no LTS supported versions of Nuitka, but mostly the stable version is hotfixed,
and would be for security issues. If possible, git rebases would be done just as they are
for corruption bugs, which would then allow to use these, but usually newer Nuitka is the
expected to use version, with main always being as bug free as possible.
