","# Security Disclosure Procedures

This document outlines security procedures and general policies for the Vuetify project.

  * [Reporting a Bug](#reporting-a-bug)
  * [Disclosure Policy](#disclosure-policy)
  * [Comments on this Policy](#comments-on-this-policy)

## Reporting a Bug

The Vuetify team and community take all security bugs in Vuetify seriously. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [security@vuetifyjs.com](mailto:security@vuetifyjs.com?subject=SECURITY) and include the word **""SECURITY""** in the subject line.

The Vuetify team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/report).

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as fast as possible to npm.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a pull request using the [issue creator](https://issues.vuetifyjs.com).
