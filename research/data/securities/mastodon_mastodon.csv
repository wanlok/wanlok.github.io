If you believe you've identified a security vulnerability in Mastodon (a bug that allows something to happen that shouldn't be possible), you should submit the report through our [Bug Bounty Program][bug-bounty]. Alternatively, you can reach us at .

You should *not* report such issues on GitHub or in other public spaces to give us time to publish a fix for the issue without exposing Mastodon's users to increased risk.

## Scope

A ""vulnerability in Mastodon"" is a vulnerability in the code distributed through our main source code repository on GitHub. Vulnerabilities that are specific to a given installation (e.g. misconfiguration) should be reported to the owner of that installation and not us.
