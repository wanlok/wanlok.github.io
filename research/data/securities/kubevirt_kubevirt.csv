## Reporting a Vulnerability
The KubeVirt project treats security vulnerabilities seriously, so we
strive to take action quickly when required.

The project requests that security issues be disclosed in a responsible
manner to allow adequate time to respond.  If a security issue or
vulnerability has been found, please disclose the details to our
dedicated email address:

kubevirt-security@redhat.com [PGP](#PGP Encryption)

Please include as much information as possible with the report. The
following details assist with analysis efforts:
  - Description of the vulnerability
  - Affected component (version, commit, branch etc)
  - Affected code (file path, line numbers)
  - Exploit code

Any confidential information disclosed to the security team will be
handled appropriately to prevent misuse or accidental disclosure.

## PGP Encryption
Security issues can often be sensitive in nature, so information can be
disclosed with PGP encryption. Our public key can be found on

Please note that the above key will not be used for signing releases.
Please refer to your vendors instructions for verifying packages, images
or source code.

Security notices will be sent to the kubevirt-dev@googlegroups.com
mailing list and published to the
[Security Advisories](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/security/advisories)
page.

## Security Team
The security team consists of key developers, vendor security contacts
and project leadership.

Membership of the security team is assessed on a case-by-case basis. If
you have cause to join the team, please sent an email to the email address
