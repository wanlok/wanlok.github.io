Hey there! While the procedure for reporting security issues is [clearly defined in my README](https://github.com/sbrl/Pepperminty-Wiki/#security), I detail it here too to make absolutely sure that nobody could possibly miss it (ref #222 and #226).

If you've found a security issue, please don't open an issue. Instead, get in touch privately - e.g. via [Keybase](https://keybase.io/sbrl) or by email (`security [at sign] starbeamrainbowlabs [replace me with a dot] com`), and I'll try to respond ASAP.

If you would like to encrypt any communications with me, you can find my GPG key [here](https://starbeamrainbowlabs.com/sbrl.asc).

Additional methods of contact:

 - The email address attached to my commits
 - My various profiles listed on my website: <https://starbeamrainbowlabs.com/>
 - Twitter: <https://twitter.com/SBRLabs>
