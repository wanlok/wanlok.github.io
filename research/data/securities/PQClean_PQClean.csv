## Current and past security issues

We will attempt to document security vulnerabilities made known to us on a best-effort basis.
If an issue is marked with a date, the issue has been resolved since any commits made after that date.

Again, we emphasise that the code in this repository has not seen any formal analysis or audit!
Use at your own risk.

### Open issues
* LEDAcryptKEM `leaktime` implementations are known to not be constant-time and expected to have timing side channel vulnerabilities.

<!-- new date line
### 2019-XX-XX

### 2019-09-24
* All Falcon implementations before [PR #235][PR 235] got merged were insecure. See [EPRINT report 2019/893][2019/893].

### 2019-09-10
* The included incremental `sha512` implementation was calling `crypto_hashblocks_sha256` before 2019-9-10.
  This lead to an insufficient security level of the results of this hash function.
  The function was not used in any implementations, though.

### Historic issues
* LEDAcryptKEM `leaktime` implementations are known to not be constant-time and expected to have timing side channel vulnerabilities.
  * LEDA support has since been dropped from PQClean as it got eliminated from the NIST PQC standardization project in round 3.
* Rainbow level I has been shown to be insecure by Ward Beullens. 
  * Rainbow was eliminated from the NIST PQC standardization project and removed from PQClean in round 4.
