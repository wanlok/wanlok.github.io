daloRADIUS does not have a dedicated security contact apart from its GitHub repository and the maintainers and project contributors
who can assist with vulnerability triage and fix.

To report security issues, and to prevent disclosing security issues publicly, please create an issue about the problem with means to contact you. 
We will reach out to you as soon as possible. Please refrain from publicly sharing information about the security issue to avoid putting users in
harms and delay a public disclosure until a fix is rolled out by the daloRADIUS team.

## Responsbile security disclosure progams

As an alternative to a GitHub issue you can also report via the following programs:
1. [Huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/) platform for responsible secure disclosures
2. [Snyk's](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure/) vulnerability disclosures program
