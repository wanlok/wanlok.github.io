## Reporting vulnerabilities

Individuals who find potential vulnerabilities in Fastify are invited
to complete a vulnerability report via the dedicated HackerOne page:
[https://hackerone.com/fastify](https://hackerone.com/fastify).

### Strict measures when reporting vulnerabilities

It is of the utmost importance that you read carefully and follow these
guidelines to ensure the ecosystem as a whole isn't disrupted due to
improperly reported vulnerabilities:

* Avoid creating new ""informative"" reports on HackerOne. Only create new
  HackerOne reports on a vulnerability if you are absolutely sure this
  should be tagged as an actual vulnerability. Third-party vendors and
  individuals are tracking any new vulnerabilities reported in HackerOne
  and will flag them as such for their customers (think about snyk, npm audit, ...).
* HackerOne reports should never be created and triaged by the same person.
  If you are creating a HackerOne report for a vulnerability that you found,
  or on behalf of someone else, there should always be a 2nd Security Team
  member who triages it. If in doubt, invite more Fastify Collaborators to
  help triage the validity of the report. In any case, the report should
  follow the same process as outlined below of inviting the maintainers
  to review and accept the vulnerability.

### Vulnerabilities found outside this process

⚠ The Fastify project does not support any reporting outside the HackerOne process.

## Handling vulnerability reports

When a potential vulnerability is reported, the following actions are taken:

### Triage

**Delay:** 4 business days

Within 4 business days, a member of the security team provides a first answer to the
individual who submitted the potential vulnerability. The possible responses
can be:

* Acceptance: what was reported is considered as a new vulnerability
* Rejection: what was reported is not considered as a new vulnerability
* Need more information: the security team needs more information in order to evaluate what was reported.

Triaging should include updating issue fields:
* Asset - set/create the module affected by the report
* Severity - TBD, currently left empty

Reference: [HackerOne: Submitting Reports](https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/submitting-reports.html)

### Correction follow-up

**Delay:** 90 days

When a vulnerability is confirmed, a member of the security team volunteers to follow
up on this report.

With the help of the individual who reported the vulnerability, they contact
the maintainers of the vulnerable package to make them aware of the
vulnerability. The maintainers can be invited as participants to the reported issue.

With the package maintainer, they define a release date for the publication
of the vulnerability. Ideally, this release date should not happen before
the package has been patched.

The report's vulnerable versions upper limit should be set to:
* `*` if there is no fixed version available by the time of publishing the report.
* the last vulnerable version. For example: `<=1.2.3` if a fix exists in `1.2.4`

### Publication

**Delay:** 90 days

Within 90 days after the triage date, the vulnerability must be made public.

**Severity**: Vulnerability severity is assessed using [CVSS v.3](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide).
More information can be found on [HackerOne documentation](https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/severity.html)

If the package maintainer is actively developing a patch, an additional delay
can be added with the approval of the security team and the individual who
reported the vulnerability. 

At this point, a CVE should be requested through the HackerOne platform through
the UI, which should include the Report ID and a summary.

Within HackerOne, this is handled through a ""public disclosure request"".
