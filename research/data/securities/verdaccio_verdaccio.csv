## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Verdaccio, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present. If you've discovered a vulnerability, please follow the guidelines below to report it to our team:

* Report it either [Snyk Security Team](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure/) or [npmjs Security Team](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/report?package=verdaccio), they will be in contact with us in case of confirming the vulnerability.
* E-mail your findings to [verdaccio@pm.me](mailto:verdaccio@pm.me). If the report contains highly sensitive information, please consider encrypting your findings using our [PGP key](https://verdaccio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gpg/publickey.verdaccio@pm.me.asc).

Please follow these rules when testing/reporting vulnerabilities:
* Do not take advantage of the vulnerability you have discovered, for example by downloading more data than is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.
* Do not read, modify or delete data that isn't your own.
* We ask that you do not disclose the findings to third parties until it has been resolved.

What we promise:
* We will respond to your report within 3 business days with our evaluation of the report and an expected resolution date.
* We will keep you informed during all stages of resolving the problem.
* To show our appreciation for your effort and cooperation during the report, we will list your name and a link to a personal website/social network profile on the page below so that the public can know you've helped keep Verdaccio secure.

## Supported versions

The following table describes the versions of this project that are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x   | :x:                  |
| 3.x   | :x:   |
| 4.x   | :white_check_mark:   |

## Responsible disclosure security policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect users of the project from publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner, and only publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period that allows patching the vulnerability and provides an upgrade path for users.

When contacting us directly via email, we will do our best efforts to respond in a reasonable time to resolve the issue. When contacting a security program their disclosure policy will provide details on timeframe, processes and paid bounties.

We kindly ask you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, the project, or any of the project’s team members at risk.

## Reporting a security issue

At Verdaccio, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use one of the following means of communications to report it to us:

* Report the security issue to the Node.js Security WG through the [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/nodejs-ecosystem) for ecosystem modules on npm, or to [Snyk Security Team](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure). They will help triage the security issue and work with all involved parties to remediate and release a fix.

Note that time-frame and processes are subject to each program’s own policy.

* Report the security issue to the project maintainers directly at verdaccio@pm.me. If the report contains highly sensitive information, please be advised to encrypt your findings using our [PGP key](https://verdaccio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gpg/publickey.verdaccio@pm.me.asc) which is also available in this document.

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to acknowledge your contributions.

## Supported versions

The following table describes the versions of this project that are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |

## Responsible disclosure security policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect users of the project from publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner, and only publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period that allows patching the vulnerability and provides an upgrade path for users.

When contacting us directly via email, we will do our best efforts to respond in a reasonable time to resolve the issue. When contacting a security program their disclosure policy will provide details on timeframe, processes and paid bounties.

We kindly ask you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, the project, or any of the project’s team members at risk.

## Reporting a security issue

> Please do not use the provided email address to report issues which are not related to security vulnerabilities

At Verdaccio, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use one of the following means of communications to report it to us:

* Report the security issue to the Node.js Security WG through the [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/nodejs-ecosystem) for ecosystem modules on npm, or to [Snyk Security Team](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure). They will help triage the security issue and work with all involved parties to remediate and release a fix.

## Supported versions

The following table describes the versions of this project that are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x   | :x:                  |

## Responsible disclosure security policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect users of the project from publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner, and only publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period that allows patching the vulnerability and provides an upgrade path for users.

When contacting us directly via email, we will do our best efforts to respond in a reasonable time to resolve the issue. When contacting a security program their disclosure policy will provide details on timeframe, processes and paid bounties.

We kindly ask you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, the project, or any of the project’s team members at risk.

## Reporting a security issue

> Please do not use the provided email address to report issues which are not related to security vulnerabilities

At Verdaccio, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use one of the following means of communications to report it to us:

* Report the security issue to the Node.js Security WG through the [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/nodejs-ecosystem) for ecosystem modules on npm, or to [Snyk Security Team](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure). They will help triage the security issue and work with all involved parties to remediate and release a fix.

Note that time-frame and processes are subject to each program’s own policy.

* Report the security issue to the project maintainers directly at verdaccio@pm.me. If the report contains highly sensitive information, please be advised to encrypt your findings using our [PGP key](https://verdaccio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gpg/publickey.verdaccio@pm.me.asc) which is also available in this document.

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to acknowledge your contributions.

## Responsible disclosure security policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect users of the project from publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner, and only publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period that allows patching the vulnerability and provides an upgrade path for users.

When contacting us directly via email, we will do our best efforts to respond in a reasonable time to resolve the issue. When contacting a security program their disclosure policy will provide details on timeframe, processes and paid bounties.

We kindly ask you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, the project, or any of the project’s team members at risk.

## Reporting a security issue

> Please do not use the provided email address to report issues which are not related to security vulnerabilities

At Verdaccio, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use one of the following means of communications to report it to us:

- Report the security issue to the Node.js Security WG through the [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/nodejs-ecosystem) for ecosystem modules on npm, or to [Snyk Security Team](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure). They will help triage the security issue and work with all involved parties to remediate and release a fix.

Note that time-frame and processes are subject to each program’s own policy.

- Report the security issue to the project maintainers directly at verdaccio@pm.me. If the report contains highly sensitive information, please be advised to encrypt your findings using our [PGP key](https://verdaccio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gpg/publickey.verdaccio@pm.me.asc) which is also available in this document.

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to acknowledge your contributions.

## Supported versions

The following table describes the versions of this project that are currently supported with security updates:

| Version   | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x       | :x:                |
| 3.x       | :x:                |

## Responsible disclosure security policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect users of the project from publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner, and only publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period that allows patching the vulnerability and provides an upgrade path for users.

When contacting us directly via email, we will do our best efforts to respond in a reasonable time to resolve the issue. When contacting a security program their disclosure policy will provide details on timeframe, processes and paid bounties.

We kindly ask you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, the project, or any of the project’s team members at risk.

## Reporting a security issue

> Please do not use the provided email address to report issues which are not related to security vulnerabilities

At Verdaccio, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use one of the following means of communications to report it to us:

- Report the security issue to the Node.js Security WG through the [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/nodejs-ecosystem) for ecosystem modules on npm, or to [Snyk Security Team](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure). They will help triage the security issue and work with all involved parties to remediate and release a fix.

Note that time-frame and processes are subject to each program’s own policy.

- Report the security issue to the project maintainers directly at verdaccio@pm.me. If the report contains highly sensitive information, please be advised to encrypt your findings using our [PGP key](https://cdn.verdaccio.org/gpg/publickey.verdaccio@pm.me.asc) which is also available in this document.

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to acknowledge your contributions.
