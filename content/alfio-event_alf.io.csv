## Note about the master branch

We consider the ""master"" branch to be always a ""Work in Progress"", and as such it might contain vulnerabilities.
Before each release we'll run an additional scan on [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/overall?id=alfio-event_alf.io) and fix all the security-releated findings.
That branch should not be deployed in production. If you do that, you're on your own.


## Reporting a Vulnerability
