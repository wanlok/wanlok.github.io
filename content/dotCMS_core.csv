## Supported Versions

dotCMS is commited to backporting security fixes to our LTS versions for up to 2 years.  These versions now include:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |

| 5.3.8 LTS   | :white_check_mark: |

Wherever possible dotCMS will also provide an osgi/hotfix plugin that can remediate a security issue without having to update you dotCMS version.
