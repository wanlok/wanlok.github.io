classified as pen-testing, security testing tools.

1. Mimikatz
2. PowerView

## Mimikatz 

Generally speaking, mimikatz has many features, primarily revolving around 
extracting, manipulating, and using Windows credentials. It can do this in many
ways. The most common method is by directly accessing and decrypting the memory 
of the Windows Local Security Authority Sub System, lsass.exe. By doing this 
it is able to get plaintext credentials from a live Windows systems. Most other 
credential access methods are only able to recover hashed credentials (which 
are still extremely useful). Mimikatz is [open source](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz), 
its [methods](http://www.nosuchcon.org/talks/2014/D2_02_Benjamin_Delpy_Mimikatz.pdf) 
as well as [detection and mitigation mechanisms](https://jimshaver.net/2016/02/14/defending-against-mimikatz/)
have been presented on. It has also been [incorporated into the Metasploit Framework](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/mimikatz/).

This repository contains compiled versions of mimikatz in both .ps1 and .dll
form. These programs have been base64 encoded and are stored in python source 
files:
- caldera\caldera\files\mimi32-dll
- caldera\caldera\files\mimi64-dll
- caldera\caldera\invoke-mimi-ps1

CALDERA uses Mimikatz to decrypt Windows passwords from the memory of 
the lsass.exe process on Windows.

## PowerView

PowerView is a PowerShell script that is used for Network Enumeration. It is
open source software contained within the [PowerSploit framework](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1).
PowerView uses Windows [Active Directory Services Interface (ADSI)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa772170(v=vs.85).aspx)
and [LDAP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa367008(v=vs.85).aspx) to
query information from the Window's Domains Active Directory server about the 
domain. 

This repository contains PowerView:
 - caldera\caldera\files\powerview-ps1

CALDERA uses PowerView to query the Active Directory server. It collects:
host and domain names of the computers in the domain, user account names, 
Administrator account names, and the Windows Domain name of the domain.",2305,b mitre/caldera 65084276694bd297fdb4d880ed9b39f3a93a52ee

","# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy 

## Introduction

This policy is intended to give security researchers clear guidelines for conducting vulnerability discovery activities and to convey our preferences in how to submit discovered vulnerabilities to us.

This policy describes **what systems and types of research** are covered under this policy, **how to send us** vulnerability reports, and **how long** we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.

We encourage you to contact us to report potential vulnerabilities in our systems.

**For vulnerability reports email us at <caldera@mitre.org>**. Reports may be submitted anonymously.  

## Authorization 

If you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your security research, we will consider your research to be authorized we will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly.  

## Guidelines

Under this policy, ""research"" means activities in which you:

-   Notify us as soon as possible after you discover a real or potential security issue.

-   Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability's presence.

-   Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly.

-   Do not submit a high volume of low-quality reports.  

## Reporting a vulnerability

Information submitted under this policy will be used for defensive purposes only, i.e. to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities. Since CALDERA is run by a not-for-profit and is open source by nature, by
submitting a vulnerability, you acknowledge that you have no expectation of payment. However, we will ensure that credit is given to the bug finder.  

## What we would like to see from you

To help us triage and prioritize submissions, please include the following in your report:

- Affected version of CALDERA (committed hash or version number), operating system used, and python version.

- Describe the location the vulnerability was discovered and the potential impact of exploitation.

- Offer a detailed description of the steps needed to reproduce the vulnerability (proof of concept scripts or screenshots are helpful).

- Be in English, if possible.  

## What you can expect from us

When you choose to share your contact information with us, we commit to coordinating with you as openly and as quickly as possible.

-   Within ***10 business days***, we will acknowledge that your report has been received.

-   After notifying the CALDERA team, we will open reported issues to the public within ***90 days***, or after a fix is released (whichever comes first).

-   To the best of our ability, we will confirm the existence of the vulnerability to you and be as transparent as possible about what steps we are taking during the remediation process, including on issues or challenges that may delay resolution.

-   We will maintain an open dialogue to discuss issues.

-   We will work with you in issuing a CVE and receiving proper credit for helping us secure our platform.  

## Questions

Questions regarding this policy may be sent to [**caldera@mitre.org**](mailto:caldera@mitre.org). We also invite you to contact us with suggestions for improving this policy.
