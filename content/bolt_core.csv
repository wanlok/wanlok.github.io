If you have found a security issue in Bolt, please send the details to
security@boltcms.io and don't disclose it publicly until we can provide a fix 
for it. If you wish, we'll credit you for finding verified issues, when we 
release the patched version.

A note on ""Self XSS""
--------------------

Bolt is a CMS, that allows users to edit content on a website. As such,
all _authenticated users_ can:

 - Edit content, and (depending on the field types) insert HTML and CSS in that
   content, with a variety of allowed attributes.
 - Depending on the user level: Edit template files, and insert HTML, CSS and
   javascript in those.
 - Upload files to the site, which will become publicly available. In the
   default settings, this includes `.PDF` and `.SVG` files.

We see these functionalities as _features_, and not as security issues. Please
report the mentioned items only if they can be performed by non-authorized
users, or other exploitable vulnerabilities.

Thanks!
