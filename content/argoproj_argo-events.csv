## Internet Bug Bounty collaboration

We're happy to announce that the Argo project is collaborating with the great
folks over at
[Hacker One](https://hackerone.com/) and their
[Internet Bug Bounty program](https://hackerone.com/ibb)
to reward the awesome people who find security vulnerabilities in the four
main Argo projects (CD, Events, Rollouts and Workflows) and then work with
us to fix and disclose them in a responsible manner.

If you report a vulnerability to us as outlined in this security policy, we
will work together with you to find out whether your finding is eligible for
claiming a bounty, and also on how to claim it.
