# Disclosure Policy

- Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and we'll make every
  effort to quickly resolve the issue.
- Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a
  third-party. We may publicly disclose the issue before resolving it, if appropriate.

  degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the
  account holder.

# In-scope

  and mobile apps (iOS and Android). Product downloads are available at https://bitwarden.com. Source

# Exclusions

The following bug classes are out-of scope:

- Bugs that are already reported on any of bitwarden's issue trackers (https://github.com/bitwarden),
  or that we already know of. Note that some of our issue tracking is private.
- Issues in an upstream software dependency (ex: Xamarin, ASP.NET) which are already reported to the
  upstream maintainer.
- Attacks requiring physical access to a user's device.
- Self-XSS
- Issues related to software or protocols not under bitwarden's control
- Vulnerabilities in outdated versions of bitwarden
- Missing security best practices that do not directly lead to a vulnerability
- Issues that do not have any impact on the general public
