The project maintainers take security seriously. If you discover a security
issue, please bring it to their attention right away!

**Please _DO NOT_ file a public issue**, instead send your report privately to
[security@docker.com](mailto:security@docker.com).

Security reports are greatly appreciated, and we will publicly thank you for it
(if you want to). We also like to send gifts&mdash;if you're into schwag, make
sure to let us know. We currently do not offer a paid security bounty program,
but are not ruling it out in the future.
