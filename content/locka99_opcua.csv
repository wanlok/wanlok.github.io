OPC UA for Rust is still ongoing development so security is addressed in the form of raising issues or contacting the author.

## Supported Versions

Vulnerabilities will be patched in the master branch and potentially the last released branch depending on the severity and nature of the issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have a security issue, raise an open issue with the ""security"" label or contact the author at locka99 @AT@ gmail.com. Issue should describe the cause for concern, a way to reproduce 
the issue and preferably a proposed fix.
