## Supported Versions

Vyper is currently in limited beta.
This means that we only support the latest release and that you may encounter issues using it.
It is un-audited software, use with caution.

If you have questions or concerns, please contact us on gitter:
[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/vyperlang/community](https://badges.gitter.im/vyperlang/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/vyperlang/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge ""Gitter"")

## Audit reports

Vyper is constantly changing and improving.
This means the lastest version available may not be audited.
We try to ensure the highest security code possible, but occasionally things slip through.

### Compiler Audits

At specific releases, we conduct audits with experienced security professionals to ensure that the codebase quality is high,
and that we minimize the chance of critical bugs as much as possible.

Here are the audits we have undergone in the past:

| Audit Type | Audit Date | Auditor | Version | Report Link |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Preliminary Review | October 28, 2019 | [ConsenSys Diligence](https://diligence.consensys.net) | 0.1.0b13 | https://diligence.consensys.net/audits/2019/10/vyper/ |

### Major Project Audits

## Known Vyper Vulnerabilities and Exposures (VVEs)

The following is a list of all publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and exposures.
Best Practices dictate that when we are first made aware of a potential vulnerability,
we take the precaution of assessing it's potential impact to deployed projects first.
When we are confident that a disclosure will not impact known projects that use Vyper,
we will add an entry to this table for posterity and reference by others.

## Known Vyper Vulnerabilities and Exposures (VVEs)

The link below is a list of all publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and exposures.
Best Practices dictate that when we are first made aware of a potential vulnerability,
we take the precaution of assessing it's potential impact to deployed projects first.
When we are confident that a disclosure will not impact known projects that use Vyper,
we will add an entry to the list of security advisories for posterity and reference by others.

## Supported Versions

Vyper is currently in limited beta.
This means that we only support the latest release and that you may encounter issues using it.
It is un-audited software, use with caution.

## Audit reports

Vyper is constantly changing and improving.
This means the lastest version available may not be audited.
We try to ensure the highest security code possible, but occasionally things slip through.

### Compiler Audits

At specific releases, we conduct audits with experienced security professionals to ensure that the codebase quality is high,
and that we minimize the chance of critical bugs as much as possible.

Here are the audits we have undergone in the past:
