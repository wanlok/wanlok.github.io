## Supported Versions

Notice that, while there are multiple versions of Janus, they're simply
tagged versions of the master Janus branch. As such, once they're tagged
as versions, they won't receive security updated. The only way to get
security updates that are published after a specific version, is to
either use a more recent tagged version (if it includes the security
fix) or refer to the master branch instead (which is where active
development focuses on). Refer to the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
file for information of what each version adds, including security
related fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In case you find a vulnerability you think we should be aware of,
please use the contact form on the [Meetecho website](https://www.meetecho.com),
using the ""Not sure/Other"" service type in the dropdown menu. We
take vulnerability reports very seriously, and so we tend to
prioritize the evaulation of such reports and, in case a fix
is indeed warranted, the development of a fix.
