### Handling

- All reports are thoroughly investigated by the Security Team.
- Any vulnerability information shared with the Security Team will not be shared with others unless it is necessary to fix the issue.
  Information is shared only on a need to know basis.
- As the security issue moves through the identification and resolution process, the reporter will be notified.
- Additional questions about the vulnerability may also be asked of the reporter.
- Note that while Flux is very active it is a vendor-neutral CNCF project maintained by volunteers, not by a single company. As such, security issue handling is done on a best-effort basis.
  Talk to us if you are interested in getting involved with this work! :-)

### Disclosures

Vulnerability disclosures are emailed to the Flux Dev mailing list  and announced publicly.
Disclosures will contain an overview, details about the vulnerability, a fix that will typically be an update, and optionally a workaround if one is available.

We will coordinate publishing disclosures and security releases in a way that is realistic and necessary for end users.
We prefer to fully disclose the vulnerability as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available.
Disclosures will always be published in a timely manner after a release is published that fixes the vulnerability.

- Any vulnerability information shared with the Security Team will not be shared with others unless it is necessary to fix the issue.
  Information is shared only on a need to know basis.
- As the security issue moves through the identification and resolution process, the reporter will be notified.
- Additional questions about the vulnerability may also be asked of the reporter.
- Note that while Flux is very active it is a vendor-neutral CNCF project maintained by volunteers, not by a single company. As such, security issue handling is done on a best-effort basis.
  Talk to us if you are interested in getting involved with this work! :-)

### Disclosures

Vulnerability disclosures are emailed to the Flux Dev mailing list  and announced publicly.
Disclosures will contain an overview, details about the vulnerability, a fix that will typically be an update, and optionally a workaround if one is available.

We will coordinate publishing disclosures and security releases in a way that is realistic and necessary for end users.
We prefer to fully disclose the vulnerability as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available.
Disclosures will always be published in a timely manner after a release is published that fixes the vulnerability.

- Any vulnerability information shared with the Security Team will not be shared with others unless it is necessary to fix the issue.
  Information is shared only on a need to know basis.
- As the security issue moves through the identification and resolution process, the reporter will be notified.
- Additional questions about the vulnerability may also be asked of the reporter.
- Note that while Flux is very active it is a vendor-neutral CNCF project maintained by volunteers, not by a single company. As such, security issue handling is done on a best-effort basis.
  Talk to us if you are interested in getting involved with this work! :-)

### Disclosures

Vulnerability disclosures are emailed to the Flux Dev mailing list  and announced publicly.
Disclosures will contain an overview, details about the vulnerability, a fix that will typically be an update, and optionally a workaround if one is available.

We will coordinate publishing disclosures and security releases in a way that is realistic and necessary for end users.
We prefer to fully disclose the vulnerability as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available.
Disclosures will always be published in a timely manner after a release is published that fixes the vulnerability.
