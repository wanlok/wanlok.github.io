## Reporting a Vulnerability

The maintainers of this project take security issues seriously. We appreciate
your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings. Due to the non-funded and
open-source nature of this project, we take a best-efforts approach when it
comes to engaging with (security) reports.

To report a security issue in the latest version of a supported version range,
send an email to [security@ericcornelissen.dev] with the terms ""SECURITY"" and
""shescape"" in the subject line. Please do not open a regular issue or Pull
Request in the public repository.

If you found a security issue in an unsupported version of the project, or if
the latest version of a supported version range isn't affected, please report it
publicly. For example, as a regular issue in the public repository. If in doubt,
report the issue privately.

### What to Include in a Report

- An explanation of the issue
- A proof of concept exploit
- A suggested severity
- Relevant [CWE] identifiers
- The latest affected version
- The earliest affected version
- A suggested patch
- An automated regression test
- A fuzz input seed or test
